Version control - Git: 

Deployed on Github pages: hosting a static website directly from a GitHub repository, making it live on the internet at a URL like username.github.io/repository-name. This process involves configuring the repository's settings to point to a specific branch and folder, and often uses automated workflows, such as GitHub Actions, to handle the deployment process whenever code is pushed. 

Responsive design principles:

Semantic HTML:
